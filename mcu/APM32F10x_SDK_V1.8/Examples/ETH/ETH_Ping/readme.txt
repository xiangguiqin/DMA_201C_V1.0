&par Example Description

This example describes how to use ethernet PHY by using APM32F10x_ETH_Driver library.
After configured ethernet mainboard will be use USART1 to printf static IP address.
if computer ping static IP address 169.254.90.123, computer will be visit mainboard normality.

The phenomenon of data interaction process can be displayed using cmd.exe.

notes: This example uses the RMII interface by default. Change "#define RMII_MODE" and "#define MII_MODE"
comment to use different interface in board_DP83848.h.

using USART1(TX:PA9, RX:PA10).
  - USART1 configured as follow:
  - BaudRate    = 115200
  - Word Length = USART_WordLength_8b
  - Stop Bit    = USART_StopBits_1
  - Parity      = USART_Parity_No
  - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
  - Receive and transmit enabled
