&par Example Description

This example shows how to configure external interrupt lines.
In this example, 2 EINT lines (KEY1 and KEY2) when using the APM32F103 MINI BOARD
are configured to generate an interrupt on each falling edge. In the interrupt
routine a led connected to a specific GPIO pin is toggled.

In this example
    - EINT0 is mapped to PA0(KEY2)
    - EINT1 is mapped to PA1(KEY1)

After EINT configuration
  when falling edge is detected on EINT0, LED2 toggles
  when falling edge is detected on EINT1, LED3 toggles
