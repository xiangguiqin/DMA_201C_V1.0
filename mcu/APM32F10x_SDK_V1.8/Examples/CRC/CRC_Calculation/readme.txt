&par Example Description

Write the calculated data to CRC DATA register and get the calculated result.
The phenomenon of Computed CRC compasses Expected CRC.
The results will be displayed on serial assistant through USART1.

using USART1(TX:PA9、RX:PA10).
  - USART1 configured as follow:
  - BaudRate = 115200
  - Word Length = USART_WordLength_8b
  - Stop Bit = USART_StopBits_1
  - Parity = USART_Parity_No
  - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
  - Receive and transmit enabled
