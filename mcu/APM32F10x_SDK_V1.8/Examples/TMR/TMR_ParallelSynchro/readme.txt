&par Example Description

This example shows how to synchronize TMR peripherals in parallel mode.

  - parallel mode:
  - TMR3 Master for TMR2 and TMR4, Configure PWM Mode and TMR3 Update event is used as Trigger Output
  - TMR2 is slave for TMR3
  - Configure PWM Mode
  - The ITR1(TMR3) is used as input trigger
  - TMR4 is slave for TMR2,
  - Configure PWM Mode
  - The ITR1(TMR3) is used as input trigger

  - The TMR3 peripherals clock is 72 MHz.

  - The Master Timer TMR3 frequency :
  - TMR3 frequency = (72M)/ (71 + 1) = 1 MHz
  - duty cycle = 36/(71 + 1) = 50%.

  - The TMR2 is running at:
  - (1 MHz)/ (3 + 1) = 250 KHz and
  - duty cycle = 2/(3 + 1) = 50%

  - The TMR4 is running at:
  - (1 MHz)/ (1 + 1) = 500 KHz
  - duty cycle = 1/(1 + 1) = 50%

&par Hardware Description

  - using TMR2 CHANNEL1(PA0) to output PWM
  - using TMR3 CHANNEL1(PA6) to output PWM
  - using TMR4 CHANNEL1(PB6) to output PWM
