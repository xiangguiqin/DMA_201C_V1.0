&par Example Description

This example describes how to use TMR5 Channel2(PA0) measure frequency of external signal.
User can view the "Frequency" value through serial terminal.

TMR5_IRQHandler Function to calculate:
Frequency = (RCM_ReadHCLKFreq()/2) / (Capture) Hz.
The minimum frequency value to measure is 1 Hz.

&par Hardware Description

using USART1(TX:PA9, RX:PA10).
  - USART1 configured as follow:
  - BaudRate    = 115200
  - Word Length = USART_WordLength_8b
  - Stop Bit    = USART_StopBits_1
  - Parity      = USART_Parity_No
  - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
  - Receive and transmit enabled

  - using TMR5 CHANNEL2(PA0) connect the external signal
