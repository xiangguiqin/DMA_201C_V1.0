&par Example Description

The program to show how to configure the TMR1 channel period 
and the duty cycle by DMA burst to generate 6 PWM 
with 6 different duty cycles (80%, 70%, 60%, 40%, 30% and 20%).

On the DMA update request, the DMA will do 5 transfers of half words into TMR1
registers (AUTORLD, REPCNT, CC1, CC2, CC3).
999 will be transferred into AUTORLD
0 will be transferred into REPCNT
800 will be transferred into CC1.
700 will be transferred into CC2.
600 will be transferred into CC3.

The objective is to generate 7 PWM signal at 1 KHz:
  - TMR1 Repetition counter =   6
  - SystemCoreClock         =   72 MHz.
  - TMR1CLK                 =   SystemCoreClock
  - Prescaler               =   71
  - TMR1 counter clock      =   1 MHz
  - TMR1_Period             =   (1000000 / 1000) - 1
  - Channel 1 duty cycle = 80%
  - Channel 2 duty cycle = 70%
  - Channel 3 duty cycle = 60%
  - Channel 3N duty cycle = 40%
  - Channel 2N duty cycle = 30%
  - Channel 1N duty cycle = 20%
