&par Example Description

This example describes how to configure the TMR1 peripheral to Encoder mode.

&par Hardware Description

using USART2(TX:PA2, RX:PA3).
  - USART2 configured as follow:
  - BaudRate    = 115200
  - Word Length = USART_WordLength_8b
  - Stop Bit    = USART_StopBits_1
  - Parity      = USART_Parity_No
  - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
  - Receive and transmit enabled

using Input Capture Channel TMR1_CH1(PA8),TMR1_CH2(PA9).
