&par Example Description

This example shows how to synchronize TMR1 and TMR peripherals in parallel mode.

  - parallel mode:
  - TMR1 Master for TMR2 and TMR3, Configure PWM Mode and TMR1 Update event is used as Trigger Output
  - TMR2 is slave for TMR1,
  - Configure PWM Mode
  - The ITR0(TMR1) is used as input trigger
  - TMR3 is slave for TMR1,
  - Configure PWM Mode
  - The ITR0(TMR1) is used as input trigger

  - The TMR1 peripherals clock is 72MHz.

  - The Master Timer TMR1 frequency :
  - TMR1 frequency = (72M)/ (71 + 1) = 1 MHz
  - duty cycle = 36/(71 + 1) = 50%.

  - The TMR2 is running at:
  - (1 MHz)/ (99 + 1) = 10 KHz
  - duty cycle = 50/(99 + 1) = 50%

  - The TMR3 is running at:
  - (1 MHz)/ (49 + 1) = 20 KHz
  - duty cycle = 25/(49 + 1) = 50%

&par Hardware Description

  - using TMR1 CHANNEL1(PA8) to output PWM
  - using TMR2 CHANNEL1(PA0) to output PWM
  - using TMR3 CHANNEL1(PA6) to output PWM
