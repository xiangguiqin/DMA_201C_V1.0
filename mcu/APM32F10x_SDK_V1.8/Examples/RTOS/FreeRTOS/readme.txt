&par Example Description

This example describes show how to use FreeRTOS create multiple tasks.

USART test task: USART1 and USART2 send or received data to each other. Verification will occur after transmission.

Led toggle task: The IO of LED2 is configured to toggle constantly.

The phenomenon of LED2 constantly flickered alternately,
if data transmission pass, LED3 will be on,
if data transmission fault, LED3 will be off.

&par Software Description

Please install the following dependencies in the directory where the installation package resides beforehand.
  - Middlewares/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOSv202012.00-LTS.exe   FreeRTOS Software Components

&par Hardware Description

USART1_TX(PA9)  ----> USART2_RX(PA3)
USART1_RX(PA10) ----> USART2_TX(PA2)

  - USART1 and USART2 configured as follow:
  - BaudRate    = 115200
  - Word Length = USART_WordLength_8b
  - Stop Bit    = USART_StopBits_1
  - Parity      = USART_Parity_No
  - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
  - Receive and transmit enabled
