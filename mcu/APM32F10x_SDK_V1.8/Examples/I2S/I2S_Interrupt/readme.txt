&par Example Description

This example describes how to use I2S peripheral.
by making a communication between the I2S2 and the I2S3.
If communication success, LED2 and LED3 will turn on.

Connect I2S2 and I2S3 pins as follows:
I2S2 WS    (PB12)   to  I2S3 WS  (PA15)
I2S2 CK    (PB13)   to  I2S3 CK   (PB3)
I2S2 SD    (PB15)   to  I2S3 SD   (PB5)
