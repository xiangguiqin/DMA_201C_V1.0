&par Example Description

This example describes how to use ADC1 and ADC2 in regular simultaneous dual mode.
The ADC1 are configured to convert ADC Channel 0(PA0).
The ADC2 are configured to convert ADC Channel 1(PA1).

A DMA request is generated each time 2 data items are available.
1st request: ADC->CDATA[31:0] = (ADC2_CH1_REGDATA[15:0] << 16) | ADC1_CH0_REGDATA[15:0]

&par Hardware Description

using ADC_Channel0(PA0)
using ADC_Channel1(PA1)

The USART1 is configured as follows:
  - TX:PA9, RX:PA10
  - BaudRate = 115200 baud
  - Word Length = 8 Bits
  - One Stop Bit
  - No parity
  - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
  - Receive and transmit enabled
