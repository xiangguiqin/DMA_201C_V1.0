&par Example Description

This example describes how to configure a communication the CAN. CAN transmit a message
from one board to another.

Transmit：
If press the KEY1, CAN1 transmit, the USART1 print "CAN1 Transmit 0x55", LED2 turns on.
If press the KEY2, CAN2 transmit, the USART1 print "CAN2 Transmit 0xAA", LED2 turns on.

Receive：
If CAN1 receive success, the USART1 print "CAN1 Receive 0x55", LED2 turns on,
else "CAN1 Receive Error", LED3 turns on.
If CAN2 receive success, the USART1 print "CAN2 Receive 0xAA", LED2 turns on,
else "CAN2 Receive Error", LED3 turns on.

The CAN connection as follows:
