&par Example Description

This example shows how to control I2C devices and communicate between two different boards.

To use this example, you need to load the software into two APM32F103_MINI boards (let's call them
Board master and Board Slave) then connect these two boards through I2C lines and GND.

 - At startup, Boards master and slave are both in slave receiver mode and wait for messages
   to be received.
 - When KEY1 is pressed on Board master, the master transmitter sent "Hello slave" to Board slave.
   The message is displayed on serial assistant through USART1 on Board slave.
 - When KEY1 is pressed on Board slave, the slave transmitter sent "Hello master" to Board master.
   The message is displayed on serial assistant through USART1 on Board master.

&par Hardware Description

   I2C     BOARD1    BOARD2
   SCL      PB6            PB6     (External Pull up resistance)
   SDA      PB7            PB7     (External Pull up resistance)

using USART1(TX:PA9、RX:PA10).
  - USART1 configured as follow:
  - BaudRate = 115200
  - Word Length = USART_WordLength_8b
  - Stop Bit = USART_StopBits_1
  - Parity = USART_Parity_No
  - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
  - Receive and transmit enabled
