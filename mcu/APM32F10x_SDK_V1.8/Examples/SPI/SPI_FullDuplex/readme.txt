&par Example Description

This example describes how to use SPI peripheral.
by making a board, the master/slave full duplex communication between the SPI and UART1.
If communication success, LED2 will turn on, LED3 will blink.

Connect UART1 and SPI pins as follows:
UART1 TX   (PA9)   to SPI MOSI (PA7)
UART1 RX   (PA10)  to SPI MISO (PA6)
UART1 CLK  (PA8)   to SPI SCK  (PA5)
