&par Example Description

This example shows how to set write protection for the flash address of APM32F103.
Select the 'FLASH_WRITE_PROTECTION' macro, the specific flash address set write protection.
Select the 'FLASH_DISABLE_PROTECTION' macro, the specific flash address remove write protection.
Select the 'FLASH_PAGE_WRITE' macro, the specific flash address will be programed.

The programming performance is showing by USART1.

The USART1 is configured as follows:
  - TX:PA9, RX:PA10
  - BaudRate = 115200 baud
  - Word Length = 8 Bits
  - One Stop Bit
  - No parity
  - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
  - Receive and transmit enabled
